**LuaLS** provides deep integration with **Lua** through the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/) project.

> **Important**  
> LuaLS for Nova is still a work in progress. I'm not sure whether this extension fully supports everything LuaLS has to offer, but it seems to work quite well with the projects I've tested.

ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

## Requirements

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension depends on external processes or tools that users will need to have, it's helpful to list those and provide links to their installers:
-->

LuaLS requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io)

<!--
âœ¨ Providing tips, tricks, or other guides for installing or configuring external dependencies can go a long way toward helping your users have a good setup experience:
-->

> To install the current stable version of Lua Language Server with Homebrew, run `brew install lua-language-server`.

## Usage

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension provides features that are invoked manually, consider describing those options for users:
-->

To run LuaLS:

- Select the **Editor â†’ LuaLS** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `LuaLS`

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Alternatively, if your extension runs automatically (as in the case of a validator), consider showing users what they can expect to see:
-->

LuaLS runs any time you open a local project, automatically lints all open files, then reports errors and warnings in Nova's **Issues** sidebar and the editor gutter:

### Configuration

<!--
ðŸŽˆ If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select LuaLS's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...**

ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!
